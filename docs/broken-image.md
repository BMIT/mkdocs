# Troubleshooting: Missing Images in Website Search

Having images not show up in search results can be due to various reasons, typically around publishing or indexing. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:

## Step 1: Verify Image Publishing

- **Find the Image:** In the `Media Library`, locate the problematic image.
- **Check Publishing Status:** Look for the `publishable` checkbox and `publish date` under the `Publish` tab.

## Step 2: Republish the Image

If the image's publishing status is uncertain:

- **Select the Image:** In the `Media Library`, click on the image.
- **Republish:** Go to the `Publish` tab and click `Publish`. Select `RePublish` and check `Publish related items`.

## Step 3: Request Reindexing

If the image is still missing in search results:

- **Contact Senthil:** Request a reindexing, providing all relevant information.
- **Verify Post-Reindexing:** Check search results again after reindexing.
